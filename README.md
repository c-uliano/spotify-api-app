# Spotify API App

<p><b>The goal:</b> connect to the api, search for songs, see the results, add songs to a list, save that list as a playlist to Spotify account.</p>
<p>I'm not concerned about styling this app. I know how to make things look good. The point is to pratice using apis and making a functional app.</p>
